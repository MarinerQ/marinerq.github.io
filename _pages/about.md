Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Institute for Gravitational Research](http://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/igr/index.php), University of Glasgow, where I also obtained my PhD. Before coming to Glasgow, I was an undergraduate at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) majoring in astrophysics. 

My research mainly focuses on:

* Gravitational-Wave (GW) Astrophysics
  * Higher-order characteristics from compact binaries: precession, eccentricity, higher modes etc, and their astrophysical implications. 
  * Tests of GR with GWs: methods and robustness. 
  * Properties of compact objects: spins, equations of state, etc. 
  * Data-driven GW waveform modeling: surrogate models and models with uncertainties. 
* GW Data Analysis Techniques
  * Waveform systematics in parameter estimation and ways of mitigating it.
  * Difficult sources in the next-generation detectors: overlapping signals, long signals, etc. 
  * Fast parameter estimation (including fast localization) of CBC sources.
  * Application of machine learning to GW data analysis: detection, parameter estimation, and follow-up sciences.
